SplitMap.py will convert an image to the set of square tiles with size of power of two
Additionaly it can create different levels of detalisation (LOD) for this map with half size of the previous level
Finally will be created config describing coordinates sizes and LODs of images

LOD 0 - 1 pixel is equals to 1x1 coordinate region
LOD 1 - 1 pixel is equal to 2x2 coordinate region
LOD 2 - 1 pixel is equal to 4x4 coordinate region
